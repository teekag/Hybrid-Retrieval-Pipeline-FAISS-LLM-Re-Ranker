# Hybrid Retrieval Pipeline – FAISS + LLM + Re-Ranker

A comprehensive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that combines semantic search (FAISS), transformer-based embeddings, a reranking layer, and LLM integration to improve factual accuracy of generated answers.

## System Architecture

The pipeline follows a modular architecture with distinct stages:

```
Documents → Preprocessing → Chunking → Embedding → Vector DB
                                                      ↑
User Query → Query Processing → Query Embedding → Vector Search
                                                      ↓
                                                  Reranking
                                                      ↓
                                               Context Assembly
                                                      ↓
                                                LLM Integration
                                                      ↓
                                               Generated Answer

## Output Example

### Query Results

```json

      "id": "hrv_basics_chunk_2",
      "content": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) serves as a window into autonomic nervous system function, providing insights into recovery status and adaptation to training. Higher HRV generally indicates better recovery and parasympathetic dominance, while lower HRV often suggests incomplete recovery or sympathetic dominance.",

### LLM-Generated Answer

```json
{
  "query": "How does HRV relate to recovery?",
  "answer": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is closely related to recovery status in athletes and serves as a valuable biomarker for monitoring recovery. Based on the provided context, HRV functions as a window into autonomic nervous system function, with higher HRV generally indicating better recovery and parasympathetic dominance, while lower HRV often suggests incomplete recovery or sympathetic dominance.\n\nHRV trends can be used to guide training decisions, where:\n- Increasing HRV trends indicate improving recovery capacity and adaptation to training\n- Stable HRV suggests maintaining homeostasis with appropriate training load\n- Decreasing HRV may signal accumulating fatigue requiring reduced training load\n\nAthletes can use daily HRV measurements to categorize training readiness into green (normal/high HRV), yellow (slightly below normal), or red (significantly below normal) days, adjusting training intensity accordingly. This approach helps optimize the balance between training stress and recovery, potentially preventing overtraining syndrome which is characterized by chronically suppressed HRV or paradoxical elevation in severe cases.",

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Place your documents in the `data/real_docs/` directory
2. Process documents using the data preparation notebook
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to explore different aspects of the pipeline:

```python
from src.rag_pipeline import RAGPipeline
from src.mistral_generator import MistralGenerator  # Or use GeminiGenerator or OpenAIGenerator

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = RAGPipeline()
pipeline.load_documents("path/to/processed_docs.json")

# Retrieve relevant documents
results = pipeline.query("How does sleep affect recovery?", top_k=3, rerank=True)

# Generate answer with LLM (choose your preferred model)
llm = MistralGenerator(model="mistral-small")
answer = llm.generate_answer(results["query"], results["results"])

print(answer)
```
