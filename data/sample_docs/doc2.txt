# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.

## Applications of NLP

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in text to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic is positive, negative, or neutral.

2. **Machine Translation**: Automatically translating text from one language to another, such as Google Translate.

3. **Speech Recognition**: Converting spoken language into text, which is used in voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.

4. **Text Summarization**: Creating a concise and coherent summary while preserving key information and overall meaning.

5. **Question Answering**: Building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language.

## Challenges in NLP

Despite significant progress, NLP still faces challenges such as understanding context, sarcasm, humor, and cultural nuances. Languages with complex grammar structures or limited digital resources also pose difficulties for NLP systems.
