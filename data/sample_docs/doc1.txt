# Artificial Intelligence: An Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—allowing it to "learn" from large amounts of data.

While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help optimize and refine for accuracy.
